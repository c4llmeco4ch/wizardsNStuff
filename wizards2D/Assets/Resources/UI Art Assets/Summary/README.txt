README Summary screen
Darken layer is semitransparent and appears over the whole screen to dim the playscreen in the background.  So the final image of the playscreen is still visible behind the summary.
Crown marks the winner. It appears at the top left corner of the character's icon, see reference. It should be at an angle.
Ideally we track who lasted the longest and casted how many spells and generate that text on the bottom half of the character icon, see reference.
